This Project Still in Progress 
            -Implemented the robot design with a pre-rendered model of the Robot
            -Implementation of Odeometry control and sensors are still remaining
            -Progressed done till having a ros-control for the simulation of the robot in gazebo

     ros-noetic-ros-controllers 
     ros-noetic-gazebo-ros-control 
     ros-noetic-joint-state-publisher-gui

     ros-noetic-turtlesim 
     ros-noetic-robot-localization 
     ros-noetic-actionlib-tools


Working of the Odometry Control:
     - By using Differential Kinematics in a 2d-plane from the postition of the Robot to detect an object and 
       estimate thier distance and indicate how far the robot has traveled, based on the amount that the wheels 
       have turned and to estimate change in position over time.
     - Inverse kinematics is used to determine the motion of a robot to reach a desired position
